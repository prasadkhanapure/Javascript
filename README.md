📘 JavaScript Deep Dives & Patterns

This repository is a curated collection of core JavaScript concepts, patterns, and edge cases, explored with a focus on understanding, correctness, and interview-level clarity.

The goal is not to memorize syntax, but to deeply understand how JavaScript behaves under the hood.

🧠 What This Repository Covers
🔹 Core JavaScript Fundamentals

Closures and lexical scope

Hoisting, TDZ (let / const)

var vs let vs const

Execution context & call stack

Event loop (microtasks vs macrotasks)

🔹 Data Structures & Language Constructs

Map vs Object (when and why)

Set, WeakMap, WeakSet

Array transformations (map, reduce, filter)

Iteration patterns (for…of, for…in, iterators)

🔹 Common Interview Problems (Explained)

Valid Parentheses (()[]{}) using stack

Array flattening

without .flat()

without recursion

Debounce & throttle using closures

Request race-condition guards

Frequency counting & grouping patterns

Each problem is approached with:

correct mental model

edge cases

why a solution works, not just how

🔹 Practical Patterns

Safe async handling (latest-request-wins)

Controlled state updates

Immutable updates

Closure-based utilities

🎯 Why This Repo Exists

Most JavaScript repos show solutions.
This one focuses on thinking.

Why Map exists when objects already exist

Why recursion can be replaced with a stack

Why for...of is safer than index loops

Why some “working” code is still wrong

This is meant to reflect real-world JavaScript reasoning, not toy examples.

🛠 Tech & Style

Plain JavaScript (ES6+)

No unnecessary libraries

Readable, intentional code

Emphasis on correctness over cleverness

This repo is part of continuous learning and interview preparation, but the patterns here are directly applicable to production code.

📌 Note

This repository is actively evolving.
New patterns and explanations will be added incrementally.
